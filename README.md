# imdb_neural_net_review_classification

This is movie review classification with the IMDB dataset using neural networks in Keras.

## Dependencies
* Keras
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib

**The model scores about 88% accuracy. It can surely be improved. Some steps to move this project further:**
1. More/less number of nodes in the hidden layers (base results with 16).
2. More/less number of hidden layers (base results with 2).
3. Using some other loss function (hint: mse) (base results with binary_crossentropy).
4. Using different activation function (hint: tanh) (base results with relu).
